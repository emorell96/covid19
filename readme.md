# Covid19 Python Code:

This code has for aim to model the current Covid 19 pandemic by using a SIIR or SIIRD model.

# Outlook:
For now the code works, in fits the model to the current data, but it lacks a very important feature: the detection probability rho!
I am trying to add this feauture by using as support this article by A. Andronico et al. (2017): "Real-Time Assessment of Health-Care Requirements During the Zika Virus Epidemic in Martinique".
